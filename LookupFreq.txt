# data = the datafile you want to import into
# subtlex is the Subtitlexus large excel sheet that has been imported into R
#word = a column in data that has the word you're looking up a value for written in lowercase

the numbers 7 and 12 listed here are the column #s that the script looks up the value in and what column in data it replaces the value for

7 = column in SUBTlexus that has the frequency info
12 = column that you are filling in for the data file
